<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I am a Senior SharePoint consultant working in <a href="http://atea.no">Atea</a> with various SharePoint projects.</p>
<p>I have been working with SharePoint in some form since 2003, i.e. since SP 2003 up until SharePoint Online/SharePoint 2016.</p>
<p>My role is mainly a hybrid SharePoint Pro and SharePoint Dev using primarily JavaScript and PowerShell</p>
<p>I have also been working extensively with a little known search engine named ViaWorks by <a href="https://virtualworks.com">VirtualWorks</a>, with a few major projects already under my belt.</p>
<p>My work experience so far comes from previously known Logica (now CGI), Statoil and currently Atea.</p>
