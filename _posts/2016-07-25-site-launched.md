After having thought about it for a long while, I decided upon returning from my Summer holidays to out together a little site that will function as a repository for my SharePoint / Office 365 related projects as well as some posts on [ViaWorks](http://www.viaworks.com/) Enterprise Search since there really is not a lot of it available (compared to SharePoint at least!).

I decided to build it with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and host it on [GitHub](https://github.com/kmosti) because I really do not wish to learn yet another CMS :)
