After having thought about it for a long while, I decided upon returning from my Summer holidays to out together a little site that will function as a repository for my SharePoint / Office 365 related projects. I decided to build it with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and host it on [GitHub](https://github.com/kmosti) because I really do not wish to learn yet another CMS :)
