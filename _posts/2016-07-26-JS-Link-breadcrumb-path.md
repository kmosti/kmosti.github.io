This post details how to add a breadcrumb path in flat library views, which is often an issue especially in large libraries with a complicated folder structure.

SharePoint views by default will display folders in regular folder structure, like this:

<!--
<img src="/images/JS-link-folderpath/xxxx.png" class="img-responsive" alt="xxxx">
-->
<img src="/images/JS-link-folderpath/1-default-view.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Default view">
